        <h3>The reason behind this website</h3>
        <p>I recently started to learn HTML and CSS. I'm not yet capable of making a complicated website, so this will do. I also really enjoy this simple aesthetic.</p><br>

        <h3>What will I be using this website for?</h3>
        <p>I'm currently looking for a place where I can post updates about the projects I'm currently working on, reviews about content I consume, and things I am learning. I do not expect to have a large audience or any audience at all; I just want to be on my corner of the internet.</p>

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I am an ordinary highschool student with a passion for technology, gaming, anime, cooking and sports.</p>
