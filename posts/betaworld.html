    <h3>I Lost My Minecraft Beta World</h3>
    <p>As the title says, I lost my Minecraft world while resetting my PC. Here's the story of how it happened.</p>

    <h3>Why Was I Playing Beta Minecraft?</h3>
    <p>To understand the situation, let's rewind a few months. Back in September, I started playing Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.<br>
        I had a vision of creating one of those worlds that you'd keep returning to year after year, building, expanding, and watching it grow.<br> 
        I also began recording my progress—each session lasting <i>2-3 hours</i>. After a while, I had accumulated around <i>67 GB of footage.</i><br>
        
        <br>Over the next couple of months, I played once or twice a week, making substantial progress. I built a house, dug a mine, started constructing a road, found diamonds, planted a forest for wood, and gathered food and resources. 
        Things were going great.</p>

    <h3>The Mistake</h3>
    <p>Then, one day, I had a brilliant idea: Why not reset my computer? <i>(You can probably guess where this is heading.)</i><br>
        I started transferring all my files to an external hard drive, but in the chaos, I forgot one crucial thing: my game saves.<br> 
        
        <br> It wasn’t until I was in the middle of the Windows installation that I realized my mistake.<br>  
        Luckily, Steam had backed up my save files, but Minecraft? Not so much. <i>And that was the moment I realized my world was gone for good.</i></p>

    <h3>Lesson learned</h3> 
    <p>Next time, I’ll take my time and thoroughly check all the files I need to back up before resetting my PC. 
        <br>Rushing through it only leads to regret, and I’ll make sure I don’t miss anything important again.</p>
