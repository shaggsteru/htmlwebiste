        <br>Sorry for not making any posts in a few months. I was very busy with school and also struggled with health issues. Now I am a little better.

        <h4>Why I decided to get a CRT?</h4>
        <p>Well, I was browsing YouTube, and stumble upon a YouTuber that used an old CRT monitor in his setup.
            He claimed it helps him stay productive and focus better on his daily tasks than a modern dual monitor setup.
            I was intrigued by his claim, so I started to look more into it.
            During my search, I also found out that are people using old CRT monitors for both retro and modern gaming.</p>

        <br><p>I could understand using an old monitor for old games. This is for what it was designed. But for modern games?!? I was a bit <i>skeptical</i>.
            I told myself, you want to get into retro games anyway, so now is you chance to test if these claims are true.</p>

        <h4>How I got the CRT?</h4>

        <p>At first, I didn’t know where to look for an old CRT, so I started browsing on eBay. If you look hard enough, you can find some CRTs at some reasonable prices, but because I don’t live in the US, the shipping cost is usually double the products value.<br>
            I decided to look locally, I found some good choices, but most of the sellers didn’t provide shipping, only local pick ups.<br>
            <br>
            I was a bit disappointed. No one has an old CRT monitor?! 15 years ago, you wouldn’t be able to find an office without one.<br>
            After a few days, I got an idea, I decided to ask my parents if they had any CRTs lying around in the storage boxes at their workplaces.</p>

        <p>I was lucky enough and found one,
                a Philips 107S6.<br>
                A got it for cheap too, the equivalent of 30$ (150 RON).<br>
            
                <br>I only had to buy a power cord and a VGA cable. That wasn’t a big problem. I bought them online and I got them in 2 days.

                <br>Now I have everything ready, but I don't have the space to place the monitor.<br>
                
                <mark>I will update this post once I have the necessary space. (Probably in a few months, when I will be renovating.)</mark></p>
