        <h3>What is "uses" about?</h3>
        <p>I wanted to share information about some of the devices and software I'm currently using. I also wanted to give other people advice <ins><i>based on my personal experience</i></ins>, so they wouldn't end up making the same mistakes I have.</p>

        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm currently using a <a href="pcspecs.html">custom-build computer</a>. I think it is far better to learn how to build your own computer than to buy a pre-built one. Firstly, you will learn a new skill that can help you earn some money, and secondly, you will actually save money, which you can invest in peripherals, monitors, or whatever you want.</li><br>
            <li>As a mobile workstation, I am using a <b>ThinkPad T520</b>. I am planning to restore and upgrade a <b>ThinkPad T61</b> in the future so I can have another mobile workstation.
                Since the moment I laid my eyes on a ThinkPad, I have fallen in love with its design. These laptops not only have a beautiful design (if you are into beefy laptops), but they are also packed to the brim with features (ports, replaceable batteries, and easy upgradeability).
                If you are interested in learning more about laptops, you can go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/">r/thinkpad</a> on Reddit and join the cult. (P.S. Use whatever thinkpad you want; don't listen to the elitists that say that only old thinkpads are good.)</li><br>
            <li>As peripherals, I use a <b>Cherry G80-11900LUMEU-0 Wired Mini Keyboard</b> and as a mouse, the <b>Logitech G502 X</b>. I chose this keyboard because of the IBM-era design and also because of the relaxing sound it makes while I'm typing.
            I bought the mouse on the recommendation of a friend. I wanted a mouse good for pretty much anything, from gaming to just simply browsing the internet.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For my operating system, I use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d"><b>Windows 10 Pro</b></a> on my main pc, and I am using Linux on my ThinkPad T520 <i>(i use arch btw)</i>.
                I am mostly using <a href="https://archlinux.org/"><b>Arch</b></a> to make myself familiar with the linux enviornment and it's programs. I also use Windows in case something goes wrong on my ThinkPad, so I can be able to finish my work until I fix the issue.</li><br>
            <li>As far as browsers go, I use Firefox with Startpage as search engine. Firefox is one of the more private browser, and paired with Startpage (a privacy focused search engine) it keeps your data safe and secured.</li>
            <li>The browsers extensions I use are:<a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> to block ads and trackers, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> for password management, <a href="https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/install/">Leechblock</a> to block all the unhealthy and distracting websites, and <a href="https://violentmonkey.github.io/">Violentmonkey</a> for running different scripts.</li>
            <li>Small list with scripts I have installed on Violentmonkey:<a href="https://adsbypasser.github.io/">AdsBypasser</a> - Bypass Ads, Popups and count-down ads; <a href="http://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/#about">Anti-Adblock Killer</a> - Bypasses anti-adblock functionality in websites; and <a href="https://github.com/artli/hide-youtube-recommendations?tab=readme-ov-file">Hide YouTube recommendations</a> - Hides the thumbnails and titles of the recommended videos to reduce distraction and procrastination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>I am using quite a lot of applications, at least on Windows, that help me with my work, productivity, and overall make my life easier. I will add later on a list with applications I'm using on Linux.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/">BleachBit</a> - Clean Your System and Free Disk Space. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a> - aims to provide an open-source software alternative to µTorrent.</li>
            <li><a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc">VLC</a> - a free and open-source, portable, cross-platform media player software.</li>
            <li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> - VSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft’s editor VS Code.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a> - best open-source email client for linux and windows.</li>
            <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> - Free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.</li>
            <li><a href="https://ninite.com/">Ninite</a> - Install and Update All Your Programs at Once</li>
            <li><a href="https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2">Jdownloader2</a> - is a free, open-source download management tool. (I would also recommend a <a href="https://real-debrid.com/">Real-Debrid</a> subscription so you can download easier from premium file hosters)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Services</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For email, I use <a href="https://proton.me/">ProtonMail</a> Despite the haters, it’s still the best privacy-respecting email service out there for most people (even though email is inherently not private).</li><br>
            <li>For consuming media I am using a self-hosted server that runs <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>. I used <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> in the past because I wanted to use the open-source and free method, but I kept having more and more issues with it. I found myself trying to repair different issues most of the time than actually enjoying content.
            I don't hate Jellyfin, I just think that it needs more time to fix some things and make a prettier interface.</li><br>
            <li>For tracking the content I watched/played/read I am using: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> - for movies; <a href="https://www.serializd.com/">Serializd</a> - for tv shows; <a href="https://anilist.co/home">Anilist</a> - for manga and anime; <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/">Backloggd</a> - for videogames, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> - for books and comics.</li><br>
            <li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is the best password manager. It does everything you could need a password manager to do, and the premium subscription if you want a few more features is dirt-cheap.</li><br>
            <li>For purchasing domains, I am currently using <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap</a>. Good prices and customer support, it really is a no-brainer. I've been using the for a couple of years now without any complaints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <ul><li>Built this website only with <b>HTML</b>, in <b>VSCodium</b>. I tried to make it as <i>simple</i> and as <i>easy</i> to use as possible.</li></ul>
